# smml:2017

Inference-based machine learning and statistical mechanics share deep isomorphisms, and utilize many of the same computational techniques (such as efficient techniques for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling).
Despite this, there has been historically poor communication between these two fields.
This meeting---the first of its kind---brings together key people from both communities to find common ground and exciting new opportunities at the interface.

The meeting will feature a series of short talks on [various topics](#topics) of relevance to the *interface* of these two fields, with the goal of exposing fruitful areas of research where both communities can make significant contributions and reap significant rewards.

## Date
<a name="date"></a>

**smml:2017** is a satellite meeting that takes place immediately before the [Berkeley Stat Mech Meeting](http://gold.cchem.berkeley.edu/statmech/current-meeting.html), and will take place **Thu 12 Jan 2017 @ 9.00A - Fri 13 Jan 2017 @ 2.00P**.

## Location
<a name="location"></a>

**Due to last-minute technical difficulties with our original venue, the workshop has been moved to 50 Birge Hall, a short distance away (~500 ft).**

[50 Birge Hall](https://classrooms.berkeley.edu/classrooms/50-birge) also has a capacity of 159, allowing us to admit more people from the waitlist.
