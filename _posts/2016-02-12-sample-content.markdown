# smml:2017

Inference-based machine learning and statistical mechanics share deep isomorphisms, and utilize many of the same computational techniques (such as efficient techniques for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling).
Despite this, there has been historically poor communication between these two fields.
This meeting---the first of its kind---brings together key people from both communities to find common ground and exciting new opportunities at the interface.

The meeting will feature a series of short talks on [various topics](#topics) of relevance to the *interface* of these two fields, with the goal of exposing fruitful areas of research where both communities can make significant contributions and reap significant rewards.
